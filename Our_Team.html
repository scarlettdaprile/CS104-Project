        Hello, my name is Valentina and I am a first year student in the Hillier College of Architecture and Design at NJIT. My favorite part about architecture is getting to create structures and re-imagine spaces. I joined Portfolio Star to help students like me who are new to the process of making a portfolio. Hope you enjoy!</p><br><br><br>
    Hello, my name is Scarlett and I am a freshman at NJIT majoring in architecture. I love the creative freedom of architecture and have always enjoyed drawing, painting and crafting. I am a member of Portfolio Star because I know it can be challenging to start off in the professional world when you feel unprepared. I want to simplify this process and our website does exactly that.<br><br>
